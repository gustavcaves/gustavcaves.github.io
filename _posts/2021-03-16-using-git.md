I started doing documentation in notion and that platform is very slow when opening links so I stopped using it too although it seems nice but it gets boring, so I decided to write down a blog post on this website to test how it was going and well it seems that it was going well but it turns out that for each video I was making a post which at a statistical level does not represent valuable information, that is, the number of blogs published, so now I am testing the same git hub in the readme.md document, a Mark Down file that allows With only text, create interesting documentation, the same one that I will use when I need to make a query quickly.

And nothing else, I just wanted to write this. ðŸ˜„
