The propose of this post is remembering to myself the basics comand to install Jekyll to use on my own computer.
So the comands are:

`bundle install`

The previous is for install the config in Gemfile

`bundle exec jekyll serve`

This is for run the server localy.

`base url: "gc_jekyll" in file called _config.yml`

`git init`

`git checkout -b gh-pages`

`git add .`

`git commit -m "commit test"`

`git remote add origin https://github.com/gustavcaves/gustavcaves.github.io.git`

`git push origin gh-pages`

There are a lot, I know but are the principals to me.

That all.
