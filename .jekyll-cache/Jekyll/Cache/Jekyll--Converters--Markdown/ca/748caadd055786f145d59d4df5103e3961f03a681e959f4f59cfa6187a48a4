I"·<p>Hello!</p>

<p>Iâ€™m Gustav Caves.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m a Computer Programmer Python, Django. Passionate about minimalism, I love to record my activities and see my progress in anything I propose, I am a programmer with and other web development technologies I try to transmit that knowledge on my blog, I do it from My experience in using whatever I publish.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m using Jekyll now, because it is so cool to edit in VS Code, so powerful and work with github, coming soon I hope translate this to AWS with my own domain gustavcaves.com</p>
